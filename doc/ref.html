The first one is called after each step in the environment, and
includes as parameters the action, destination state, reward, and
whether the new state is terminal. The second is called at the start of
each episode, and has a parameter for the initial state. The last two
are called at the start and end of the overall main loop. 

For example, the gold standard algorithm inherits from <code>&lt;q-learning-algorithm&gt;</code> 
and <code>&lt;model-learning-algorithm&gt;</code> (recall that CLOS has multiple inheritance).  
As a result, it must implement <code>get-q-fn</code> and <code>get-mdp</code> which take in a knowledge-state 
from the history and return the corresponding q-function and mdp respectively.


ALisp consists of all of standard Lisp, together
with the following new operations :
<ul>
<li> <code>(action a)</code> : do <code>a</code> in the environment. </li>
 
<li> <code>(get-state)</code> : get the state of the environment.  </li>
<li> <code>(with-choice (v l) body)</code> : execute body with variable <code>v</code> bound to an element of list <code>l</code>.
The program doesn't specify in advance how to make this choice.
Instead, it will learn by experience how to make the choice (as a
function of the current environment and program state).</li>
<li> <code>(call function-call)</code> : do the function call, and
inform the ALisp system that a new subtask has been entered. The idea
is that we can improve the performance of learning algorithms by making
use of the task structure.</li>
</ul>

The <code>call</code> is implemented as a trivial choice with one possibility, and so all function calls done using <code>call</code> are present on the choice stack.

<code>(inform-arrive-choice omega)</code> : inform observer that we've just reached a choice with joint state <code>omega</code>.</li>
<li><code>(inform-choice-made omega u)</code> : inform observer that choice <code>u</code> was made at <code>omega</code>.</li>
<li><code>(inform-leave-choice)</code> : inform observer that we've just left the body of the highest choice in the choice stack.</li>
<li><code>(inform-part-prog-terminated</code> : inform  observer that the partial program has terminated.</li>

<p>
In the example given, we define the choice points and subtasks as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>nav</code>: until we reach the destination specified by loc, choose from '(N E S W) and set that choice to be dir; label this choice nav-choice and execute dir as a move action<br>
<code>get-pass</code>: call the partial program subtask nav to get to the passenger's source location, and then execute a pick up action</br>
<code>put-pass</code>: call the partial program subtask nav to get to the passenger's destination location, and then execute a drop action</br>
</blockquote>

We then combine the choices in a hierarchical manner in order to define the partial program's structure.  For this purpose, we use
the <code>choose</code> function, which determines a root choice point (labeled <code>top</code>) as the repeated getting and putting
of passengers, as you might expect from a taxi:

<blockquote><code>
(defun td-taxi-prog ()
  (loop 
    (choose top 
	    (call get-pass ())
	    (call put-pass ()))))</code></blockquote>
