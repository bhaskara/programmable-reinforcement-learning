<body><h2>Environments</h2>

<h3>Creating an example environment</h3>
<p>
We use the standard paradigm of an agent interacting with an
environment by doing actions, observing percepts, and receiving
numerical rewards.  Code for interacting with environments is in the
<code>env-user</code> package, methods of which are described in the
reference <a href="ref/env-user.html">here</a>.  The class
<code>&lt;env&gt;</code> is the abstract class from which all
environments inherit.
<p>
For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the Taxi Domain
introduced in Tom Dietterrich's paper on MAXQ.  The
<code>td-taxi-env</code> package defines the class
<code>&lt;td-taxi-env&gt;</code>, which is the Taxi Domain.  The class
has various parameters, such as the size of the map, possible
passenger destinations, and so on.  The method
<code>make-example-env1</code> creates a particular instantiation with
a very small (2 by 3) map.

Try creating an example environment as follows:

</p><blockquote>
<pre><code>(use-package 'td-taxi-env)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>(setf e (make-example-env1))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

The use-package might cause some warnings about new symbols being interned.  These can be ignored using whatever restart mechanism is present in your Lisp (e.g. the <code>:continue</code> command in Allegro Lisp).

</p><h3>Interacting with environments</h3>
<p>
To see how this environment works, we use <code>rl-user:io-interface</code> function.  This allows you to 
interact with an environment by typing in actions.  Type nil to quit. Here is an 
<a href="env-io-example.html">example interaction</a> in the taxi 
environment.
               
</p><p>
Algorithms that interact with environments will not use <code>io-interface</code>.  Rather they will use lower-level
operations such as <code>reset</code>, <code>do-action</code>, and
<code>get-state</code>.  See the <a
href="ref/env-user.html">reference</a> for more details.
</p><p>
<b>Exercise</b> : Try interacting with the taxi environment using the lower-level operations.


</p><h3>Making new environments</h3>

If you use this code, you will probably need to create new
environments.  Use the <code>create-env</code> package.  Creating a
new fully observable environment type is done by subclassing
<code>&lt;fully-observable-env&gt;</code> and overriding some of the
operations to describe the initial state distribution and transition
model.  If your environment is partially observable, subclass the more
general <code>&lt;env&gt;</code> class.  In this case, you need to
define methods for <code>sample-percept</code> and
<code>sample-init-percept</code> in addition to the ones above.  Most
of the currently existing code assumes fully observable environments.
For an example, see <a
href="../lisp/envs/taxi/td-taxi-env.lisp">envs/taxi/td-taxi-env.lisp</a>.  
<p>
It is often convenient to specify an environment transition
distribution using a structured representation such as a dynamic
Bayesian network.  This can be done using the <code>bnet</code>
package.  For an example, see <a
href="../lisp/envs/taxi/qe-taxi.lisp">envs/taxi/qe-taxi.lisp</a>.  

For a more complete description of the functions and data structures
that need to be implemented when creating new environments, see the <a href="ref/create-env.html">reference</a>.

<b>Exercise</b> : create a subclass of <code>&lt;env&gt;</code> for your favourite
environment, and verify that it works using <code>io-interface</code>.
