<h3>Sets in the ALisp system</h3>
In the ALisp system, sets can be represented in several ways.  First, a list or vector  represents the set consisting of its elements.  Second, a fixnum n represents the set of integers 0, 1, ..., n-1.  More complex types of sets can be defined by subclassing <code>&lt;set&gt;</code> - see the <code>set</code> package for details.
