<h1>The env-user package</h1>

The <code>env-user</code> package contains code for interacting with
environments.  This is useful for
<ul>
<li>Using terminal I/O to control an agent in an environment to get a
feeling for how the environment works.
<li>Writing learning algorithms that interact with the environment.
</ul>
<p>
The operations in this package are:
<ul>
<li><code>do-action ENV ACTION</code> : do an action in an
environment, and return three values: 1) The reward 2) The next
percept (usually the state) 3) A boolean which is true if the
environment has terminated.
<li><code>get-state ENV</code> : return the state of the environment.
<li><code>reset ENV</code> : reset the environment state using the
initial-state distribution.
<li><code>reset-to-state ENV STATE</code> : reset the environment
state to a particular state.  Not all environments implement this.
<li><code>at-terminal-state ENV</code> : Is the environment at a
terminal state?
<li><code>get-actions ENV</code> : Return the set (usually represented
as a list) of actions available at the current state of the
environment.
<li><code>io-interface ENV</code> : Allows the user to interact with
the environment using the terminal.  The user enters actions and these
are performed in the environment and the next state displayed.  When
using this function, make sure to use the package of the environment
(using <code>use-package</code>) to make sure that any symbol names
you type as actions get turned into symbols in the right way.
</ul>
