<a name="defsubroutine">
<h2><i>Macro</i> defsubroutine</h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>defsubroutine <i>function-name lambda-list</i> &rest <i>args</i></code>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>function-name</i> - A symbol (not evaluated) 
<li><i>lambda-list</i> - A lambda list
<li><i>args</i> - The remaining args are the same as for the macro <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/mac_defun.html#defun"><code>defun</code></a> in common Lisp
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

Defines a new function named <i>function-name</i> in the global
environment, using <code>defun</code>.  In addition, causes the <a
href="#subroutine-description">subroutine description</a> to be added
to <a href="#subroutine-description-table"><code>*subroutine-description-table*</code></a>
with key <i>function-name</i>.	This has the effect that, if this
function is invoked elsewhere in the code using <code>call</code>, the <a href="#variable-name">variable names</a> of <a href="#frame-entry">frame entries</a> in the corresponding <a href="#choice-stack-frame">choice stack frame</a> will be set using <i>lambda-list</i>.
</ol>

<h3>Discussion of design choices</h3>

I chose to have a separate construct for this rather than shadow <code>defun</code> because I wanted to keep the possibility of just defining a function in the normal way.  For example, if the user writes a <code>compute-shortest-path-to-goal</code> helper function that contains no choice points, there's no need to add it to the Alisp subroutine descriptions.   <code>defsubroutine</code> is reserved for functions that really correspond to some ``task'' in the environment.


<a name="call">
<h2><i>Macro</i> call</h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>call <i>function-name</i> &rest <i>args</i></code>
<p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>function-name</i>, not evaluated, is the name of an ALisp subroutine<br>
<i>args</i>, not evaluated, is a <a href="#lambda-list-with-choices">lambda-list with choices</a>.
<p>
<h3>Description</h3>
Expands to code that :
<ol>
<li>Updates the <a href="#program-counter">program counter</a>.
<li>Sets the <a href="#next-frame">next frame</a> of the current joint state to be a new <a href="#frame">frame</a> with label <i>function-name</i>.
<li>For each parameter that is <a href="#specified">specified</a> by <i>args</i>, looks up its name in <code>*subroutine-description-table*</code>, and adds a <a href="#frame-entry">frame entry</a> to the new frame using the parameter name and corresponding value from <i>args</i>.  For unspecified parameters, adds a frame entry whose value is the symbol <code>unspecified</code>.
<li>Uses the <a href="#currently-active-completion">currently active
completion</a> to make a choice, which is a list including, for each argument in <i>args</i> that is not specified, a value from its <a href="#choice-list">choice list</a> (which is evaluated).  The completion is given a <a href="#copy">copy</a> of the joint state.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> about the choice that has been made at this joint state.  The observers receive a copy of the joint state.
<li>Fills in the unspecified parameters of the new frame using a the choice that was made.
<li>Adds the new frame to the <a href="#choice-stack">choice stack</a> .
<li>Calls the function named by <i>function-name</i> with the specified and chosen arguments.
<li>Informs all observers that the <a href="#choice-block">choice block</a> is about to be exited.
<li>Removes the top element from the choice stack.
<li>Returns the return value of the call to <i>function-name</i>.
</ol>

<h3>Exceptional situations</h3>

If there is no entry for <i>function-name</i> in <code>*subroutine-description-table*</code>, then an error is signalled.


<h3>Example</h3>

Removed for now due to changes.

<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Note that any items on a stack frame that are compound objects are passed by reference.  However, before passing the joint state to a completion or any observers, it is copied.  Suppose, for example, that function <code>foo</code> is called with parameter <code>a</code> being the array [1 2 3].  Learning algorithm L1 is informed of this choice and notes the current joint state.  Meanwhile, within <code>foo</code>,  the first element of <code>a</code> is set to 0.  Later, a choice point is reached, and the current joint state must be passed to completion C1.  What values of a are present in C1's copy of the current joint state and L1's copy of the previous state?  The answer is that C1's copy shows <code>a = [0 2 3]</code> and L1's copy shows <code>a = [1 2 3]</code>.  Thus, the stack frame's information is kept as current as possible, but completions and observers can nevertheless assume that a joint state that is passed to them will not change 'under their noses'.
<li>The motivation for having <code>choose-arg</code> be allowed rather than just using <code>with-choice</code> is that, this way, more information can automatically be put in the choice stack frame.
</ol>

<a name="choose">
<h2><i>Macro</i> choose</h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>choose <i>label</i> <i>form_0</i> ... <i>form_n</i></code>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>label</i>, not evaluated, is the <a href="#label">label</a> for this choice point<br>
<i>form_i</i>, not evaluated, is a form

<h3>Description</h3>
Expands to code that

<ol>
<li>Updates the <a href="#program-counter">program counter</a>.
<li>Sets the <a href="#next-frame">next frame</a> of the current joint state to be a new <a href="#frame">frame</a> with label <i>label</i>.
<li>Adds a single entry to the new frame with name being the symbol <code>choice-index</code> and value unspecified.
<li>Uses the <a href="#currently-active-completion">currently active
completion</a> to choose a value between 0 and n for <code>choice-index</code>.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> about the choice that has been made at this joint state.
<li>Fills in the value of <code>choice-index</code> in the frame.
<li>Adds the new frame to the <a href="#choice-stack">choice stack</a>.
<li>Evaluates the chosen form.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> that the <a href="#choice-block">choice block</a> is about to be exited.
<li>Removes the top element from the choice stack.
<li>Returns the return value of the form that was evaluated.
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>

Removed for now due to changes.

<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

<ol>
<li>See first point in discussion for <code>call</code>.
</ol>





<a name="with-choice">
<h2><i>Macro</i> with-choice</h2>
</a>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>with-choice (<i>label</i> (<i>choice-var choice-list</i>)) &rest <i>body</i></code>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>label</i>, not evaluated, is the <a
href="#label">label</a> of this choice point<br>
<i>choice-var</i>, not evaluated, is a symbol <br>
<i>choice-list</i>, evaluates to a list<br>
<i>body</i>, not evaluated, is a list of forms surrounded by an implicit <code>progn</code>

<h3>Description</h3>
Expands to code that


<ol>
<li>Updates the <a href="#program-counter">program counter</a>.
<li>Sets the <a href="#next-frame">next frame</a> of the current joint state to be a new <a href="#frame">frame</a> with label <i>label</i>.
<li>Adds a single entry to the new frame with name being the symbol <code>choice-var</code> and value unspecified.
<li>Uses the <a href="#currently-active-completion">currently active
completion</a> to choose a value from <code>choice-list</code> for  <code>choice-var</code>.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> about the choice that has been made at this joint state.
<li>Fills in the value of <code>choice-var</code> in the frame.
<li>Adds the new frame to the <a href="#choice-stack">choice stack</a>.
<li>Evaluates the body with <code>choice-var</code> bound to the chosen value.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> that the <a href="#choice-block">choice block</a> is about to be exited.
<li>Removes the top element from the choice stack.
<li>Returns the return value of the last form evaluated in <i>body</i>.
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>


Removed due to changes.

<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

Comparing the above example to the one for <code>call</code>, less
information is automatically added to the stack this way, but the body
of the choice can be an arbitrary form rather than a single function
call.

<a name="get-state">
<h2><i>Function</i> get-state</h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>get-state &optional (<i>fresh</i> nil)</code>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>fresh</i> is a Boolean.  

<h3>Description</h3>
Returns the current state of the environment, or a copy if <i>fresh</i> is true.

<h3>Discussion of design choices</h3>

<ol>
<li>It seems safer to have a function that returns the state rather than just expose the state directly to the user.
<li>Note that the return value is the env state itself unless <i>fresh</i> is true.  Thus, it is an error for partial programs to modify this object in any way unless <i>fresh</i> is true.  Also, if for some reason the partial program wants to store previous states in its memory, it should again set <i>fresh</i> true.
</ol>

<a name="action">
<h2><i>Macro</i> action</h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>action <i>action</i> &optional <i>label</i>
<p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>action</i>, evaluated, is an object denoting an action in the environment.
<i>label</i>, not evaluated, is the label for this action point.  If it is not provided, and <i>action</i> (unevaluated) is a symbol, then it defaults to this symbol.
<p>
<h3>Description</h3>

Expands to code that
<ol>
<li>Updates the <a href="#program-counter">program counter</a>.
<li>Informs all <a href="#observer">observers</a> that an action is about to be done.
<li>Performs <i>action</i> in the environment.
<li>Informs all observers of the reward and new environment state.
<li>Returns nothing.
</ol>

<h3>Exceptional situations</h3>

<ol>
<li>If <i>action</i> is not a legal action in the current environment state, then an error is signalled.
<li>If the environment is at a terminal state, then an error is signalled.
</ol>





<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

The main decision here is whether to treat actions differently than, e.g. a statement of the form <code>(setf x 3)</code>.  Currently they are treated differently, in that observers are informed, and a new choice block is started.  This means that learning algorithms will have the opportunity to learn a Q-function at action states, even though there is no choice to be made.  I think this might help reward to flow more smoothly via Bellman backups, especially in function approximation settings.  It might be worth allowing the user to make this decision though.

<a name="mem">
<h2><i>Macro</i> mem </h2>
</a>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>mem <i>item</i> &optional <i>item-key</i>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>item</i>, evaluated, is any object.
<i>item-key</i>, not evaluated, is a symbol.  If <i>item</i> (not evaluated) is a symbol, then <i>item-key</i> may be omitted, and defaults to this symbol.

<h3>Description</h3>

Sets the <a href="#value">value</a> corresponding to <i>item-key</i> in the top frame on the <a href="#choice-stack">choice stack</a> to be <i>item</i>.  Has the same result regardless of whether a <a href="#frame-entry">frame entry</a> with this key is already present in the frame.

<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Allows the user to add information to the choice stack that is not automatically added by <code>call, choice</code> or <code>with-choice</code>.  Ideally, it would not be necessary for the user to do this, but we have not figured out a good way for the system to automatically add all bindings to the stack.
<li>Note that the discussion after <code>call</code> about adding compound objects by reference still applies.
</ol>


<a name="gmem">
<h2><i>Macro</i> gmem</h2>
</a>


<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>gmem <i>item</i> &optional <i>item-key</i>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<i>item</i>, evaluated, is any object.
<i>item-key</i>, not evaluated, is a symbol.  If <i>item</i> (not evaluated) is a symbol, then <i>item-key</i> may be omitted, and defaults to this symbol.

<h3>Description</h3>

Sets the <a href="#value">value</a> of the <a href="#frame-entry">frame entry</a> corresponding to <i>item-key</i> in the <a href="#global-frame">global frame</a> to be <i>item</i>.  Has the same result regardless of whether an entry with this key is already present in the frame.

<h3>Discussion of design decisions</h3>

<ol>
<li>This is to allow users to specify information relevant to a policy that is not specific to any particular level of the stack, e.g. a map of the environment, or, in the case of POMDPS, the current belief state in the case of POMDPs.
<li>Note that the discussion after <code>call</code> about adding compound objects by reference still applies.
</ol>


<a name="state"><h1>Contents of the joint state</h1></a>
<p>
The state of a running ALisp program is called the joint state.  The ALisp system is responsible for making sure that the joint state is up-to-date before sending any messages to the completion or observers.

The joint state consists of the <a href="#env-state">environment state</a>, <a href="#program-counter">program counter</a>, <a href="#global-frame">global frame</a>, <a href="#choice-stack">choice stack</a>, and <a href="#next-frame">next frame</a>.


<a name="running"><h1>Running an ALisp program</h1></a>

Every time an ALisp program begins, an <code>inform-start-episode</code> message is sent to all observers.  The program starts execution at the top-level subroutine.  Statements in standard Lisp are executed using Lisp semantics, and Alisp-specific operations are executed according to the descriptions above.  Upon termination of the program, an <code>inform-part-prog-terminated</code> message is sent to all observers.  It is an error for the partial program to terminate when the environment has not terminated.
