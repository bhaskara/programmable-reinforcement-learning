<h1>The create-env package</h1>

The <code>create-env</code> contains symbols used when defining new
environments.  The top-level class for environments is
<code>&lt;env&gt;</code>.  General environments can be partially
observable.  To create a fully observable environment, subclass
<code>&lt;fully-observable-env&gt;</code>.  

When creating an environment, you first need to decide on a
representation for states and actions.  States and actions can be any
Lisp object, e.g., numbers, lists, hashtables, or structures.  We
recommend, however, that you define a structure type for your
particular environment's states and actions. See, for example, <a
href="../../lisp/envs/taxi/td-taxi-env.lisp">envs/taxi/td-taxi-env.lisp</a>,
which defines a type <code>td-taxi-state</code>.  Defining an new type
rather than just using, say, a list, is good because you can define
methods that specialize on this type.  For example, the standard Lisp
generic function <code>print-object</code> when applied to a
<code>td-taxi-state</code> prints a nice readable representation
showing the map, as can be seen when using the
<code>io-interface</code> (see the example in the tutorial).  If you
define a type for states or actions, you should define methods for
<code>clone</code> (which creates a fresh copy of a state) and
<code>same</code> (which tests equality). If you plan to ever use
states or actions as keys in a hashtable (for example, when using a tabular
Q-function representation), you should also define
<code>canonicalize</code>. Fortunately, these methods are usually
quite straightforward to write - you should be able to proceed by
analogy with the methods for <code>&lt;td-taxi-env&gt;</code>.
<p>
The specific operations that must be implemented for fully observable
environments are:
<ul>
<li>One of <code>sample-next</code> or <code>do-action</code>.
<li>One of <code>sample-init</code> or <code>reset</code>.
<li><code>is-terminal-state</code>.
<li><code>avail-actions</code>.
<li><code>sample-percept</code>, if the environment is not fully
observable.
<li><code>sample-init-percept</code>, if the environment is not fully
observable.
</ul>
<p>
Here are descriptions of these operations.
<ul>
<li><code>sample-next STATE ACTION</code>.  Sample and return two
values: 1) The resulting state after doing <code>ACTION</code> in <code>STATE</code> 2) The
reward obtained from this move.
<li><code>do-action ENV ACTION</code> : do an action in an
environment, and return three values: 1) The reward 2) The next
percept (usually the state) 3) A boolean which is true if the
environment has terminated.
<li><code>sample-init ENV</code>.  Sample the initial state of the environment.
<li><code>reset ENV</code> : reset the environment state using the
initial-state distribution.
<li><code>is-terminal-state ENV STATE</code> : return t if <code>STATE</code> is a
terminal state and nil otherwise.
<li><code>avail-actions ENV STATE</code> : Return the <a href="set.html">set</a> of available actions at <code>STATE</code>.
<li><code>sample-percept ENV STATE ACTION REWARD NEXT-STATE</code> :
sample the percept observed after doing <code>ACTION</code> in <code>STATE</code> and moving to
<code>NEXT-STATE</code> with reward <code>REWARD</code>.  Not required for subclasses of
<code>&lt;fully-observable-env&gt;</code>.
<li><code>sample-init-percept ENV STATE</code>.  Sample the initial
percept given that the initial state is <code>STATE</code>.  Not required for
subclasses of <code>&lt;fully-observable-env&gt;</code>.
</ul>
