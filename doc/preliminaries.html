<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This tutorial is intended to get you familiar with ALisp.  It assumes
that you have a working knowledge of Lisp, and a version of Common Lisp
installed.

The tutorial contains examples that illustrate the various features of
ALisp.  Following along with these should give you a basic idea of
how to use ALisp.  There are also exercises in each
part.  Working through at least some of these is encouraged if you
want to use or extend ALisp for your own purposes.

Since this code is still in development, there may be various
issues/bugs/inconveniences/incompabilities that you find.  Please <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bhaskara">contact</a> me with all of these.



<h3>Obtaining and setting up ALisp</h3>

Go to the <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bhaskara/alisp/download.html">download page</a> for
instructions on how to download and install the ALisp system.

Start up Lisp and change to the ALisp code root directory <code>alisp-system/lisp</code>.  Load and compile the code as follows :

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(load "hrl-system.lisp")
(make-all)
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>
This should compile without warnings.  Next, to make sure the code is working, load the file
<code>test/test-all.lisp</code>:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(load "test/test-all.lisp")
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>
This will run scripts that test out various parts of the code.  The scripts should produce continuous output displaying their progress, and terminate in a few minutes, with no errors or warnings.

<h3>Setting up Concurrent ALisp</h3>

The ALisp system also includes an implementation of Concurrent ALisp.
Because Common Lisp does not specify a standard for multithreading,
our implementation is specific to Allegro Lisp, versions 6.2 or
greater.  If you are using Allegro Lisp and want to use Concurrent
ALisp, after starting Lisp, first type:

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(push ':concurrent-alisp *features*)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then, follow the instructions in the previous section.  Finally, to
check that concurrent ALisp has been installed properly, type

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(load "test/test-calisp.lisp")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

This will take a few minutes, but should produce continuous output
displaying progress, and complete with no errors or warnings.

<h3>Getting help</h3>

Once the code is loaded into Lisp, the <code>help</code> function can
be used to display documentation of various parts of the system.
Calling <code>(help)</code> without arguments will list all packages
for which help is available.  Otherwise, help is called with a single
unevaluated symbol argument.  If there is a package having the same
name as the given argument, documentation for that package will be
printed.  For example, try <code>(help alisp-user)</code>.  If there
are any functions or types having the same name as the provided
symbol, help will print the documentation for each of them.  Try, for
example, typing <code>(help learn)</code>.  For the rest of this
tutorial, you can use the <code>help</code> function to find out more
about the various parts of the system as they are introduced.

There is also a set of scripts to make it easier to find definitions
in the Lisp code.  They can be found in the <code>alisp-system/scripts</code> directory, and
will require some basic knowledge of bash to adapt to your system.



<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

I would like to acknowledge two excellent external pieces of code used by ALisp : Daniel Barlow's asdf package, and Tunc Simsek's help package.
