1) hrl/scripts is in your path
2) you're using bash

hcvst - different version of same thing
lgrep - grep for a regexp in all lisp files
lispfiles - list all .lisp files in lispdirs
lispdirs - list all directories that aren't CVS or external
make-alisp-release - copy over the files that are needed for alisp release
